MINT PROTOCOL

Category: NFT

Challenge: Gear Technologies


Description:

The growth of the NFT market has generated the need to build new alternatives and methods for generating NFT collections for users.
On the other hand, the advancement of artificial intelligence as a technological tool for the generation of art is a trend that will continue to grow in the coming years.
For this reason, Mint protocol will offer an alternative method for the generation of new NFT collections combining artificial vision with facial recognition and 
the most sophisticated algorithms of artificial intelligence, an example is the style transfer algorithms (NST) based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
The NST algorithms allow the use of artificial intelligence to extract the style characteristics of the most beautiful works and transfer them while maintaining their characteristic essence.
Mint Protocol is a decentralized application that generates NFT collections using artificial vision with facial recognition and neural transfer style (NST) based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs).For the generation of NFT collections, smart contracts were compiled to WASM on the Gear network.
